Tab,Element,Definition
1,   Distribution Change   , Changes in geographic species distribution (= 'distribution shifts') can increase risks of ineffective spatial catch allocation; if catch distribution is greatly mismatched with species distribution OY may not be achieved. The conceptual model highlights factors contributing to distribution change and elements affected by distribution change.
2,   Estuarine Habitat   , Both neashore and estuarine (mixed fresh and seawater) water column and bottom features constitute estuarine habitat. Threats to estuarine and nearshore coastal habitat/nursery grounds relate to OY through changes in both fish productivity and distribution change. The conceptual model links specific climate effects and human activities to estuarine habitat and habitat to summer flounder population characteristics that ultimately affect OY.     
3,   Fluke SSB (Stock Biomass)   ,  The risk assessment used biomass levels relative to established reference points from assessments indicate the level of risk to achieving OY. The conceptual model highlights processes contributing to changes in stock biomass and elements affected by stock biomass.
4,   Stock Assessment   ,  Assessment methods and data quality shape our understanding of stock status and yield. This risk element addresses risk to achieving OY due to scientific uncertainty based on analytical limitations.  The conceptual model highlights factors contributing to assessment uncertainty and elements affected by the assessment.  
5,   Offshore Habitat   ,  Offshore habitat can be defined as a combination of water column and bottom features. Climate and human activities can alter offshore habitat. The conceptual model links climate and human effects on offshore habitat to summer flounder population characteristics that ultimately affect OY.     
6,   Allocation   ,   This element addresses the risk of not achieving OY due to spatial mismatch of stocks and management allocations or because of sub-optimal allocation by sector (commercial/recreational) and/or area (state/region). The conceptual model links elements affecting allocation with elements affected by allocation.
7,   Commercial Profits   , The risk assessment addressed the risk of not maximizing fishery value in terms of commercial profits (although it used revenue as a proxy).  The conceptual model highlights factors contributing to and affected by commercial profits.   
8,   Discards   ,  Stakeholders have identified the reduction of discards as a high priority in the Council management program--those caused by regulations since they represent biological and economic waste.  Discards of either the target or non-target species in the fishery are included. 
9,   Fishery Resilience  ,  This element ranks the risk of reduced fishery business resilience due to changes in shoreside support infrastructure.    
10,   Fleet Diversity   ,   This element ranks the risk to maintaining equity in access to fishery resources. Maintaining diversity can provide the capacity to adapt to change at the ecosystem level for dependent fishing communities and can address objectives related to stability.    
11,   Management Control   ,  This element addresses the level of management control in terms of catch estimation (measurement) and monitoring to prevent overfishing. Adequate management control indicates a low risk of overfishing. Poor management control indicates a higher risk of overfishing and hence not achieving OY.    
12,   Recreational Value   ,  Providing recreational opportunities is a stated goal of optimal fishery management as part of the definition of "benefits to the nation" under MSA. Recreational fishing is important in the Mid-Atlantic region with many coastal communities having high recreational dependence.     
13,   Regulatory Complexity   , Constituents have frequently raised concerns about the complexity of fishery regulations and the need to simplify them to improve their efficacy. Complex regulations may lead to non-compliance and/or impact other fisheries.
14,   Seafood Production   , The risk assessment evaluated optimizing domestic seafood production from MAFMC managed species. Commercial seafood landings (as opposed to total landings which include bait and industrial uses) were used to assess seafood production. The conceptual model links elements contributing to seafood production with elements affetced by seafood production.
15,   Technical Interactions   ,  This element addresses the risk of not achieving OY due to interactions with non-MAFMC managed species including protected species. Here the risk is caused by negative consequences from fishing activity regulated under MAFMC FMPs which interacts with exploited or protected species managed by other agencies.  Interactions with marine mammals protected under the MMPA could result in greater restrictions in MAFMC managed fisheries increasing the risk that OY would not be achieved in those fisheries.       
16,   Offshore Wind   ,  This element addresses the risk of fishery displacement or damage of a fishery resource and/or habitat that supports it as a result of non-fishing activities in the ocean (specifically wind energy).  
17,   Other Links   , Some links were required in the conceptual model which did not otherwise reflect a previously defined risk element. They are listed here.
